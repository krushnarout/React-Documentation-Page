# FreeCodeCamp Technical Documentation Page

This repository contains my completed FreeCodeCamp Technical Documentation Page project. The project was created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

## Project Overview

The Technical Documentation Page is a web page that provides documentation for React. I designed this differently from FreeCodeCamp and also added a dark mode toggle button to showcase my understanding of HTML, CSS, and responsive web design principles.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html` - The main HTML file containing the technical document page structure.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that styles the technical document page.

## Preview

Here's a screenshot of the Technical Documentation Page without dark mode:
